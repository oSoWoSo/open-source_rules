OPEN SOURCE RULES - from us for us

why?

- because to long We are overruled by morons
- and We known how We want live
- and make it better

basic rules:

1. Open-source must be promoted everywhere
2. All software/format used by governments must be open-source
3. Closed-source software/format cannot be enforced to public use
4. Rules are created in as simple as posible readable form using choosed versioning control system 
5. Anyone can contribute to rules
6. Rules are added after most people vote for it
7. Any rule cant break basic rules


This project is (repair me if I am wrong) first attempt to create real open-source rules which can be used for taking care of our countries and our world.



Everybody just talking about changes, lets make it real

Join REAL revolution!
