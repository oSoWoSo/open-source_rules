OPEN SOURCE RULES - from us for us

why?
- because "The pen is mightier than the sword"
- bacause Words are mightier then money.
- because We can.
- because Only all together we can make it best.
- because We want real democracy.


basic rules:

1. Any kind of nature cannot be prohibited
2. Open sources must be promoted everywhere
3. All software/format used by governments must be open source
4. Closed sources software/format cannot be enforced to public use
5. Rules are created in simple as posible readable form using choosed versioning control system (git)
6. Anyone can contribute to rules
7. Rules are added after most people vote for it
8. Any rule cannot break basic rules


This project is (repair me if I am wrong) first attempt to create real open source rules which can be used for taking care of our countries and our world.



Everybody just talking about changes, lets make it real
